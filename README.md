Sample Git Workflow

Step 1: Checkout a feature branch (e.g. ‘git checkout –b feature/addlogin’)
Step 2: Make changes to repo
Step 3: Add and commit changes
Step 4: Rebase from the upstream dev branch to your feature branch (e.g. ‘git pull –rebase upstream dev’ Be sure to do this while you are on your feature branch)
Step 5: Resolve merge conflicts (if there are any)
Step 6: Push changes to your personal github account (e.g. ‘git push origin feature/addlogin’)
Step 7: Submit pull request from your personal github to the org’s github (the pull request should be from your feature branch to the org’s dev branch)
